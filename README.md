### Loan Status Prediction Using Machine Learning

This is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application built using Python's Tkinter library to predict loan approval status based on user-provided information. The prediction is made using a pre-trained machine learning model.

## Features

- Predicts whether a loan will be approved or not based on user inputs.
- Provides feedback to the user about the loan approval status.
- Validates user inputs and displays error messages for invalid values.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Amrit-2002/loan_prediction_system.git
2. Install Dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas joblib
3. Make sure you have a trained machine learning model saved as 'loan_status_predict' (using the joblib library) in the same directory as the application

## Usage
4. Enter the required values in each field:\
   -Gender (1 for 'Male' 0 for 'Female')\
   -Married (1 for 'Yes' 0 for 'No')\
   -Number of Dependents\
   -Education (1 for 'Educated' 0 for 'Uneducated')\
   -Self-Employed (1 for 'Yes' 0 for 'No')\
   -Applicant Income\
   -Coapplicant Income\
   -Loan Amount\
   -Loan Amount Term (In months)\
   -Credit History (Enter '1' for Good and '0' for Not Good)\
   -Property Area (Enter '0' for Rural '1' for Urban '2' for Semiurban)\
